     - Example:
     ```js
        myPromise.then(
        function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
        function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
        );
     ```

2. Contact Form:
    1. User tries to submit form with invalid information
    2. Inbuilt validation validates iin correct information has been inputted by user
    3. Prompts user to make sure all required form fields are filled

3. Responsiveness:
    1. As a user I expect the information presented in the project to be responsive on all devices
    2. Use chrome dev tools to check responsiveness of each web page  

4. User API Tests:
